<td>When you step through your door and look around at your community, what do you see? Do you see an urban oasis? Do
you  see  nature  filtering  through  the  cracks  in  the  pavement?  For  this  project,  we  will  be  examining  our  home communities  and  our  school  community  in  order  to  accept  the  inherent  beauty  that  already  exists  and  to  identify  the areas of change that need to happen. You will work independently to document  images of these  places  and then work
collaboratively with a group to create a proposal, a documentary, and a DVC community garden space.
<td> I honestly enjoyed this project a lot. It gave me the chance to learn more about the importance of green spaces and how I can contribute to the bettering of my earth. I was also greatful that I was able to be hands on when it came to creating a greenspace my freshman year.

<td> This year we have explored what histories make us who we are, injustices in the world, and the positive effects of green spaces. We also know that words and music together have the power to communicate ideas to enormous audiences. For this project part of your challenge is to identify positive events, people, and/or movements that are making positive changes in the community or world. Additionally, you will write and create a song or poem to perform in front of the class. Finally, the class will then decide on one song for which to create a music video that conveys a celebration of the good in our world.
</td>
<td> I thought it was a fun way to express myself. I felt that it was something that everyone can do. I believe that everyone has a creative side and this project gave us the opportunity to explore that side.
