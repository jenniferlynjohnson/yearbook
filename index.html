<center><p> I honestly enjoyed this project a lot. It gave me the chance to learn more about the importance of green spaces and how I can contribute to the bettering of my earth. I was also greatful that I was able to be hands on when it came to creating a greenspace my freshman year.

<center><p> I thought it was a fun way to express myself. I felt that it was something that everyone can do. I believe that everyone has a creative side and this project gave us the opportunity to explore that side.</p></center>
